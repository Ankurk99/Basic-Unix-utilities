# Basic-Unix-utilities
The aim of the project is to write basic Unix utilities like 'cat', 'ls', 'grep', etc in C language. The project will help in the better understanding of Unix file system, Shell scripting and writing Makefiles.

---

# Project Idea
This project aims to create programs that would mimic the basic functionality of
some common Unix utilities using C, eg:
- `cat` : concatenate and display
- `cp` : copy files
- `mkdir` : make a directory
- `ls` : list the contents of a directory

# Checkpoints
- Fork and make a basic pull request to the repository adding the link to your
    repository
- Write a basic implementation of cat in C
- Write a basic implementation of ls in C
- Write a basic implementation of grep in C
